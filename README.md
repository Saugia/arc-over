# Arc-Over
This repository is for the Endless Sky plug-in "Arc Over". This plug-in is in early development, expect additions and changes in the future.

## About
Arc Over gives limited angles to turret mounts on vanilla ships, adding another balance aspect to combat gameplay. These arcs are determined by a few factors, and are given exceptions in some cases, some being more lentient than others, and others being no limits at all. For detailed information, see the about.txt file included in the plug-in's directory, as well as the arc notes.txt file in the data folder for specific choices for each faction.
** Note: This plug-in currently only includes human ships. More to come in the future.
